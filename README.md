Sentiment Analysis using CNN-LSTM

This project implements a Sentiment Analysis model using a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. This hybrid model is designed to analyze text data and classify the sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral.

# Overview
The CNN-LSTM model is a powerful combination that captures both local patterns within word embeddings (using CNN) and sequential dependencies in text (using LSTM). This makes the model suitable for applications that require nuanced sentiment classification.

# Model Architecture
Embedding Layer: Transforms words into dense vector representations.
CNN Layer: Detects local feature patterns (e.g., n-grams) in the embeddings.
LSTM Layer: Captures the temporal dependencies in the sequence.
Fully Connected Layers: Processes the combined output for the final classification.

Why CNN-LSTM?
CNN is effective at extracting key phrases or n-grams that carry sentiment.
LSTM is well-suited for capturing contextual sentiment patterns in sequences.
# Dataset
This project requires a dataset for training and evaluation, structured as follows:

Text: The sentence or document to be analyzed.
Label: Sentiment label, typically encoded as:
0: Negative
1: Neutral
2: Positive
